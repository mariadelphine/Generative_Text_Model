*DESCRIPTION* : This project demonstrates a Generative Text Model built with the GPT-2 architecture using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model generates human-like text based on a user-provided prompt, showcasing the power of modern deep learning language models for natural language generation tasks. By loading a pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer, the system processes the input prompt and produces coherent, contextually relevant text continuations. It supports sampling techniques such as temperature control and nucleus (top-p) sampling to introduce diversity and creativity in the generated outputs. The implementation handles padding tokens to avoid errors during tokenization and generation, ensuring smooth execution. This model can be used for various applications including creative writing assistance, chatbot responses, code generation, or any task requiring automated text generation. Its ease of use and adaptability make it suitable for both beginners and advanced users interested in exploring the capabilities of large-scale language models.

Key Features:
*Utilizes the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face Transformers.
*Supports interactive text generation from user-provided prompts.
*Implements advanced sampling techniques such as temperature and top-p (nucleus) sampling to control creativity and randomness.
*Handles tokenizer padding to avoid common errors during generation.
*Outputs fluent, coherent, and contextually relevant text.
*Easy to extend for custom fine-tuning or integration with other NLP pipelines.

Technologies Used:
*Python 3
*Hugging Face Transformers library
*PyTorch
*Pre-trained GPT-2 language model
